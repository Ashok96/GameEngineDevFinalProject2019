This is a simple tappy ball game implemented in Unity. 

I have tried to add sound effects on the game that were discussed on the book like reverberation, echo, doppler effect, stereo blend etc. 
The sound effects are not randomly placed but rather i tried to coordinate the sound with the  game situation.
i.e Whenever, the game is going on and the tappy ball is still alive a certain music on background  that  resonates its progression ahead is put.
Once the ball is tapped,a different sound is produced, which indicates the ball is tapped.
Whereas, if it collides  with any of the collider, a bursts sound comes into place which indicates the collison  and explosion  and the player gets notified that he  is  dead. 

Ad Analytics:

Similiarly, i have implemented ad analytics and it successfully displays the place holder for the  advertisement once the user dies. 
This is a good place for placing ads because once user dies, he/she is in hurry to play it again
and accomplish that they were not able to do on previous attempt. Hence, the probablity of watching ads by user is higher in this case.

There are several other features partially implemented like level two and score board which are not within the scope of the class.
But this project was a steep learning curve for someone like me with no prior unity experience and c# skills.Hence the tutorials in 
udemy were extremly helpful.
